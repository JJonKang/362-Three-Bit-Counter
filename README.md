# Three-Bit-Counter
Description: Two buttons are used to control the three leds used as binary digits.<br />
One button increases "presses" by 1, the other button decreases it by 1.<br />
Debouncing has been implemented on the buttons to make sure it accurately <br />
Blue led = first digit, Red led = second digit, white led = third digit<br />
The number created by "presses" is converted into binary<br />
for the leds to use.
